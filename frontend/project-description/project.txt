Learning Platform:

The Learning Platform is a project to offer you a wealth of information about courses provided by various universities, 
coaching institutes, and online learning platforms. Whether you're searching for free courses or exploring paid 
options, you'll find everything you need right here.

Learning Platform also offers its own courses, designed to help improve our knowledge and skills. 
With our user-friendly interface, you can easily enroll in courses and access modules to enhance your learning experience.

To make your learning journey  more enriching, I've integrated a Wikipedia search feature. Now, you can research
any topic of interest right from our platform. Simply enter your search query, and it provide you with a brief 
description and a link to the corresponding Wikipedia page.

The Learning Platform is built using the latest web technologies. I've used Django for both front-end and back-end development,
ensuring a seamless user experience. With Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript, I've created an intuitive and visually 
appealing interface.

Understanding that learning is not just about acquiring knowledge but also about testing and applying what you've 
learned, I'm adding a "Test Yourself" feature. This will allow you to assess your knowledge through quizzes.

I'm also planning to introduce a chatbox feature so you can ask questions and clarify doubts in real-time. 
Additionally, I'm exploring Three.js to enhance the visual appeal of our website.In the backend, I've set up tables 
such as User, Courses, Modules, Purchase, User Access, and Scraped Courses to ensure smooth operation and management 
of data.And I'm also working on an analytical tool using Power BI, which will provide insights into user behavior and preferences based on user details and course enrollment data.
